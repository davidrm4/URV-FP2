COMMENTED CODE for both THEORY and LAB CLASSES

Download updated versions of ZIP files containing commented code seen in both theory and lab classes. 
The code is organized in folders 'Theory' and 'Labs', with numbered subfolders, and projects named according to the topic at hand.
For example, folder 'Theory\1\Linked List' provides commented code for an implementation of a linked list, 
as that seen in part 1 of the theory lectures.

Most of the code is provided in the form of solutions (SLN) for Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition.
In any case, all source (C) and header (H) files are readable as text files.
Further, some executables (EXE) may cause false positives when scanning for viruses. 
For this reason and also to reduce file size, most executables have been removed and recompilation will be required.
